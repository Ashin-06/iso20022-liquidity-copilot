# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately, through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting on this repository (Security → Report a vulnerability) or by contacting the
maintainer, [@Ashin-06](https://github.com/Ashin-06), directly. Do not open a public issue.

Include what you found, how to reproduce it and what an attacker could do with it. You should
get an acknowledgement within 5 working days. Please give us 90 days to fix an issue before
disclosing it, and don't test against anyone else's deployment.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 1.0.x | yes |
| < 1.0 | no (prototype releases) |

## Scope

In scope: the API, the ISO 20022 parser and generator, the settlement engines, the stored queue
and positions, the container image and the CI configuration in this repository. A way to make a
settlement run book balances that don't match the payments it settled, or to settle a payment
twice, is the most serious class of report.

Out of scope: the made-up scenarios and the stress model's assumptions, any real RTGS or SFMS
system, and findings that need an already-compromised host or a leaked API key with the matching
role.

This project has **not** had an independent security review or penetration test.
